# ENV 872 - Demo Project: Malaria Case Rates vs Rainfall

This project explores the relationship between rainfall and malaria case rates in Amazonian Peru. Since mosquitos, the vectors for several species of malaria, require water to breed, I expect that increased rainfall would lead to increased mosquito populations, and therefore case rates as well. 

## Hypotheses: 

* Malaria case rates vary randomly across time and space.
* Rainfall levels vary randomly across time and space.

* Increased malaria case rates <u>are not</u> related to increases in rainfall. 

  

## Workflow

### Data prep

* Import, wrangle and summarize malaria case rate data
* Import, wrangle, and summarize rainfall data

### Data exploration, visualization, & analysis

#### Malaria Case Rate Data

* What is the **range** of malaria case rate values? 
* What is the **distribution** of these values in terms of variance, skewness, kurtosis? 
* Is there a **spatial trend** in case rates? 
* Is there a **temporal trend** in case rates? 

#### Rainfall Data

* What is the **range** of rainfall? 
* What is the **distribution** of rainfall in terms of variance, skewness, kurtosis? 
* Is there a **spatial trend** in rainfall levels? 
* Is there a **temporal trend** in rainfall levels? 

#### Case rates vs rainfall

* Does a scatterplot of malaria case rates vs rainfall suggest a correlation?
* Does a GLM of malaria case rates vs rainfall suggest a correlation?
